### CPSC 120

* Lab 7

    Lab 7, part 2 was a one of my favorite labs to work on as I enjoy playing Blackjack and creating a game-like program was really engaging. This lab allowed me to utilize functions for the very first time  to calculate the value of a blackjack hand and it obviously is a skill I still impliment in my code to this day.

* Lab 9
    
    Lab 9, Part 2 was a challenging programming problem for me and required me to think a good amount before reaching the solution. The premise was that there are two philosophers living together, and essentially, we are checking if a given schedule was valid given that they cannot eat together for some reason. The lab required the usage of indexes of a vector of strings composed of 5 letters, with each letter being 's' or 'e.' The letter 's' represented when they were sleeping or thinking, while 'e' represented when the philosophers were eating, which again, they could not do simultaneously. Each philosopher had a 5-letter schedule, and we were to compare them using substrings and indexes to ensure 'e' was never at the same position for them.

* Lab 1

    As funny as it sounds, Lab 1 has a special place in my heart. Although objectively it was the most simple thing we did this year, it was the entry to the world of programming for me and has served as a constant reminder of my growth. That aside, the lab consisted of configuring our git and setting up GitHub along with printing Hello World and our names for the first time using std::cout. I will love this lab forever!
